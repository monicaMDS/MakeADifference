                    <h3><b>Tentative Solution/Proposition/500 Words</b></h3>
                    <p>What do you do with the food scraps when you cook? Do you throw them away, reutilise them in
                        other
                        dishes,
                        or compost them?<br> For people of all interests, Sage C. (placeholder name) will help you
                        compost
                        your
                        food waste, whether you are a beginner or not!</p>

                    <p>Composting food waste is an important process in reducing our impact on the environment,
                        saving money and improving soil. By composting, we will be keeping a valuable resource out of
                        the
                        landfill.<br>
                        Organics in landfills break down anaerobically (without energy) to produce methane gas, a
                        greenhouse
                        gas.
                        Using compost instead of chemical fertilisers also means that the fertiliser run off cant go
                        into
                        our rivers,
                        lakes and streams. </p>

                    <p>Less water will be wasted, as compost helps with moisture retention and the compost nutrients
                        will
                        not be washed away.
                        Soil quality will be improved with valuable nutrients to help maintain soil quality and
                        fertility.
                    </p>

                    <p>This company will make starting the journey easy, and improvements if you are already utilising
                        your
                        food waste.
                        Whether you are in an apartment in the city, or a house in the suburbs, this company will make
                        composting easy.</p>

                    <p>This company will offer multiple solutions, unique to each person's situation. By taking a quiz
                        when
                        first
                        visiting their website, they can accurately determine which solutions will suit the user's
                        situation
                        the best.</p>

                    These potential options include :
                    <ul>
                        <li>a starter composting kit for people who are new to composting</li>
                        <li>a standard composting bin</li>
                        <li>a paper composting bin that can also be composted</li>
                        <li>a composting bin that can sit on your kitchen sill or smaller spaces, that turns food waste
                            into
                            soil fast</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The user would be able to make an account with the company, to keep track of any products that've
                        been purchased,
                        and to ask potentially ask questions on a forum with other people with questions in
                        composting/gardening. There could
                        be company products mentioned above featured in the website. The products would be optionally
                        purchased, and delivered
                        to the user.</p>

                    <p>This company would be contactable and accessible from a website (possibly an app).
                        This website would feature a quiz to that user's can take to see what solution is best depending
                        on
                        their situation.
                        The website would have information on how to start composting, and answers to any composting
                        questions. Ideally,
                        there would be all the information a person would need (beginner or experienced) in one spot.
                    </p>

                    <p>The service will also show when compost should be turned, and how long it will take before
                        compost
                        will
                        turn into soil depending on what has been put in there. A cute visual would be to have an image
                        that
                        turns
                        into soil (eventually a plant?) as time passes, corresponding with how long it takes for compost
                        to
                        turn into soil
                        (2 weeks - 2 years).</p>

                    <p>The main idea is to make composting more accessible and easy,
                        therefore encouraging more people to start composting.
                        By doing this, we can help complete the cycle of returning what we grow, back to soil to
                        continue
                        growing!</p>

                    <p>My target users are those who primarily want composting to be quicker, more efficient, but just
                        as
                        eco friendly. They can be people who are new to composting, or those who are very experienced.I
                        finder
                        that these people are generally adults, as they become more aware of their own impact on the
                        envrionment
                        and have their own living sitution. <br> To display the range of potential users, I have created
                        a set of personas.
